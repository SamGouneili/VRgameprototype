i don't know what i'm doing


SO FAR:

Resources I have gathered:
- first person example map
- some starter content/code
- 3D hand model from the open source web

Coded so far:
- tracing using the camera
- prints what I have pointed at
- traces when I left click
- trace has range
- object that has PHYSICS comes to me when clicked on and traced over (without physics it stays)
- When clicked on cone it spawns objects I can pull

Want to do??:
- (c)create volume that static mesh 'clicks into'
- (a)maybe make some material
- find things to do..

Theme so far/story boarding:
- I seem to like the single creepy hand
- story board for magic use possibly
- can be either platformer or puzzle game right now; have no clue tho
